# OpenFlexo Demo Server

This page is a demo page for OpenFlexo as a server for multiple clients.
The code for this demo is available on this [GitHub](https://github.com/openflexo-team/openflexo-demo).

The tree bellow presents a set of directories and files. 
When selecting a element, you can change it's name in the **Name** text field.
For directories, you can add children directories pressing the button <i class="material-icons">folder</i> 
or files with <i class="material-icons">portrait</i>. 
When selecting a file, the <b>Icon</b> text field allows to change the file icon. 
The icons are selected from the [Material icons](https://material.io/icons), just put the name to get the icon.
 
The data of the tree is shared with all clients and **synchronized** with each change.

Come see us at [openflexoorg](http://openflexo.org).
